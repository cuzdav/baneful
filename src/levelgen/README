This c++ code is not necessary for the game but is used as a level
generator.  It's like a mini-embedded repo, hence the second directory
named 'src'.  At this point nothing more of a fun experiment, but the
purpose is a few challenges: 

1) generate random levels (to some critera) - not started

2) create an ability to determine if two levels are functionally
equivalent, if rules are simply reordered, or blocks are colored
differently but are isomorphisms of each other. 
  - some progress. 

This will prevent creating a bunch of random repeats of each other,
and has some interesting "colored graph isomorphism" problems to work
on and learn from.


This is developed with g++11 and c++20, but may work on older versions
(I just haven't tried verified yet.)  Create an empty build directory
`src/levelgen/build`, then cd inside it, and generate the makefiles:

cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++

(change compiler path as desired.)
